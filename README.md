# Image Attribution Tagger

Image attribution is important. This is especially true If you are using free images under a Creative Commons license. 
The Image Attribution Tagger plugin makes it easy to tag images with the needed information. It provides a content 
entry fields to the media library. You can add the attribution as you upload an image, or later when you use the image. 
It also allows you to select the location where the attribution will appear. You can have the attribution appear after 
the content or in the caption area.
