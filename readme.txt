== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add an attribution? =

You can add the attribution as you upload an image or after the image is uploaded, select the image and add the attribution using the text box labeled Attribution Tag in the attachment detail area. If you elect to have the attribution appear in the image caption, this needs to be done before the image is added to the post. If the image has been added, simply delete the image in the post and add it again once the attribution is added via the Media Library.

= Can I add a link to the attribution? =

Yes a link can be used in the License Text box. Standard HTML is required, Ò<a href=Òhttp://anydomain.comÓ>Anchor Text</a>Ó
